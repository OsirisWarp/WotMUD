# WotMUD
Scripts and other documents for Wheel of Time MUD primarily for the Mudlet client

Currently using the fantastic pack Adael as built (https://github.com/weisluke/WoTMUD) as a base for all additional work. Most current project is color coding items to determine rough value. See below for examples, this should not be counted as 100% accurate as item values and worth change.

This is not an exhaustive list, but is designed to help newer players (any myself) in determining what may be worth picking up and what can be left on the group. 
If you have any suggestions or need assistance with any part please let me know.
